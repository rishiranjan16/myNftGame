This is an NFT based battle game that holds trait of NFTs and updates it , all within a blink of the eye . Users can mint an nft / character and fight the boss 
It will also attack the boss as well as loose health while doing so as the boss will attack too at the same time . Its a pretty fun game . 

I have built this using - 
Solidity 
React.js
Hardhat 
javascript 
OpenZeppelin libraries 
Custom base64 library
